         <p>We reimagine the way the world moves for the better
        Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood.<br> It runs through our veins. It’s what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to<br> constantly reimagine how we can move better. For you. For all the places you want to go.<br> For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire<br> world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.</p>

        <p>Read our full mission statement</p>
        <p>We are Uber. The go-getters. The kind of people who are relentless about our mission to help people go<br> anywhere and get anything and earn their way. Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood. It runs through<br> our veins. It’s what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine how we can move<br> better. For you. For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want<br> to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.<br><br>
            We are a tech company that connects the physical and digital worlds to help make movement happen at the<br> tap of a button. Because we believe in a world where movement should be accessible. So you can move and earn<br> safely. In a way that’s sustainable for our planet. And regardless of your gender, race, religion, abilities, or sexual <br>orientation, we champion your right to move and earn freely and without fear. Of course, we haven’t always<br> gotten it right. But we’re not afraid of failure, because it makes us better, wiser, and stronger. And it makes us<br> even more committed to do the right thing by our customers, local communities and cities, and our incredibly<br> diverse set of international partners.<br><br>
            The idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination<br> and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of<br> people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-<br>wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you<br> need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is<br> a top priority every single day. At Uber, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never stops, and is always<br> just beginning.</p>

        <p>Sustainability
            Uber is committing to becoming a fully electric, zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking place in<br> zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with micromobility. It is our responsibility as the largest mobility platform <br>in the world to more aggressively tackle the challenge of climate change. We will do this by offering riders more ways<br> to ride green, helping drivers go electric, making transparency a priority and partnering with NGOs and the private<br> sector to help expedite a clean and just energy transition.
